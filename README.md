# Analysis of UFC Fighters

Physical and Technical Characteristics and Their Influence on Performance

## Description

This project aims to analyse different aspects of UFC fighters to understand how they influence performance. Through an exploratory data analysis (EDA), it seeks to confirm whether certain physical factors and fighting styles have a significant impact on the success of fighters.

## Main Goals
The main objectives of this analysis is to confirm whether certain physical aspects and fighting styles influence the performance of UFC fighters. The following hypotheses are proposed:
Relationship between height, weight, and reach: Evaluate if there is a correlation between these physical characteristics and performance in combat.

Impact of stance on performance: Determine if fighters with an "Orthodox" stance perform better (measured by the number of victories) compared to fighters with a "Southpaw" stance.
Age and performance: Investigate if a fighter's age is correlated with their number of victories or defeats, exploring how experience and physical condition vary with age.
Comparison between strikers and grapplers: Examine if fighters who land more significant strikes per minute (SLpM) are more successful than those who focus more on takedowns and submissions.

## Methodology
To carry out this analysis, a database of UFC fighters was collected and processed, including variables such as height, weight, reach, age, stance type, and combat performance statistics (SLpM, takedowns, submissions, etc.).

## The analysis includes:
Descriptive analysis: Statistical summary of the physical and technical characteristics of the fighters.
Data visualisation: Graphs and diagrams to illustrate the distribution and relationships between variables.
Hypothesis testing: Statistical evaluation to confirm or refute the proposed hypotheses.

## Expected Results
In summary, this project aims to shed more light on the factors that contribute to success in the UFC, using a data-driven approach to validate the proposed hypotheses.
